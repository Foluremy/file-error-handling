# file-error-handling

This repository contains Python code demonstrating file reading, writing, and error handling. The code reads a text file, modifies its content, and writes the modified content to a new file. It also includes error handling to gracefully handle exceptions like file not found or I/O errors.


File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
